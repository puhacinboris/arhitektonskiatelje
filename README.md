# Arhitektonski atelje
Project was created for an architecture firm “Arhitektonski atelje” based in Podgorica, Montenegro.<br>
The project was a custom content management system which allowed the client to have a complete overview of firm’s basic information and projects with the ability to update it.<br>
This was a team project created in collaboration with two other team members.<br>
It was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript for the frontend and PHP, MySQL and PHP framework “Laravel” for the backend.<br>
Sadly the project doesn’t exist anymore but the wonderful experience and some mockups remain.<br><br>
